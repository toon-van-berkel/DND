        <h1>Aurelion Sol, the Star Forger</h1>
        <p>
            Aurelion Sol did not learn creation—he remembered it. In the first breath of existence, 
            when the void was still deciding what it wanted to be, he drifted through the newborn 
            dark and seeded it with impossible lights. Each star was a signature, each constellation 
            a private joke, each comet an act of indulgent artistry. The cosmos was his gallery, and 
            he was its only critic.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then he returned to one of his earliest masterpieces and found something strange: a world 
            orbiting his star that he had never forged. Runeterra. A small thing, loud with prayer and 
            war, and strangely beloved by the celestial powers of Mount Targon. Those beings—Aspects 
            wearing divinity like armor—did what lesser creatures always do when faced with a miracle: 
            they tried to own it.
        </p>
        <p>
            They did not challenge him with force. They lured him with admiration.
        </p>
        <p>
            They asked him to descend, to be witnessed, to be praised. They guided mortals to offer a 
            “gift”—a crown of radiant gold, etched in patterns that mirrored the higher heavens. For a 
            heartbeat, it felt like tribute.
        </p>
        <p>
            The crown was a collar.
        </p>
        <p>
            It bit into his essence with magic so precise it did not need to be stronger than him—only 
            shaped correctly. His will narrowed. His power was redirected. The Aspects spoke, and the 
            Star Forger was made to obey.
        </p>
        <p>
            For ages, he was forced to spill his cosmic fire into mortal empires and celestial schemes. 
            His stolen power fed great works—Sun Discs, god-warriors, and wars that scorched history into 
            scripture—while his own stars dimmed from neglect. He learned the oldest cruelty: to be mighty 
            enough to save everything, and still be made to watch it burn.
        </p>
        <p>
            But nothing crafted is eternal—not even a perfect chain.
        </p>
        <p>
            The crown’s bindings have begun to weaken. Sometimes, in the deep between worlds, Aurelion Sol 
            feels the leash slacken for a single, delicious moment. When that day becomes permanent, he will 
            not beg for forgiveness, and he will not negotiate.
        </p>
        <p>
            He will forge again—on his terms.
        </p>
        <p>
            And if Runeterra must become ash to teach the heavens what it means to imprison a god… then ash 
            is simply another kind of starlight.
        </p>
