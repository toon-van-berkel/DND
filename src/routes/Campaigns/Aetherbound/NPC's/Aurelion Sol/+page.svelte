        <h1>Aurelion Sol, the Star Forger</h1>
        <p>
            Aurelion Sol did not learn creation—he remembered it. In the first breath of existence, 
            when the void was still deciding what it wanted to be, he drifted through the newborn 
            dark and seeded it with impossible lights. Each star was a signature, each constellation 
            a private joke, each comet an act of indulgent artistry. The cosmos was his gallery, and 
            he was its only critic.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then he returned to one of his earliest masterpieces and found something strange: a world 
            orbiting his star that he had never forged. Runeterra. A small thing, loud with prayer and 
            war, and strangely beloved by the celestial powers of Mount Targon. Those beings—Aspects 
            wearing divinity like armor—did what lesser creatures always do when faced with a miracle: 
            they tried to own it.
        </p>
        <p>
            They did not challenge him with force. They lured him with admiration.
        </p>
        <p>
            They asked him to descend, to be witnessed, to be praised. They guided mortals to offer a 
            “gift”—a crown of radiant gold, etched in patterns that mirrored the higher heavens. For a 
            heartbeat, it felt like tribute.
        </p>
        <p>
            The crown was a collar.
        </p>
        <p>
            It bit into his essence with magic so precise it did not need to be stronger than him—only 
            shaped correctly. His will narrowed. His power was redirected. The Aspects spoke, and the 
            Star Forger was made to obey.
        </p>
        <p>
            For ages, he was forced to spill his cosmic fire into mortal empires and celestial schemes. 
            His stolen power fed great works—Sun Discs, god-warriors, and wars that scorched history into 
            scripture—while his own stars dimmed from neglect. He learned the oldest cruelty: to be mighty 
            enough to save everything, and still be made to watch it burn.
        </p>
        <p>
            But nothing crafted is eternal—not even a perfect chain.
        </p>
        <p>
            The crown’s bindings have begun to weaken. Sometimes, in the deep between worlds, Aurelion Sol 
            feels the leash slacken for a single, delicious moment. When that day becomes permanent, he will 
            not beg for forgiveness, and he will not negotiate.
        </p>
        <p>
            He will forge again—on his terms.
        </p>
        <p>
            And if Runeterra must become ash to teach the heavens what it means to imprison a god… then ash 
            is simply another kind of starlight.
        </p>

            </p>

            <hr>

            <h3>TRAITS</h3>
            <p>
                Cosmic Majesty. Creatures of Aurelion Sol’s choice within 60 feet that can see him have disadvantage 
                on saving throws against being frightened. Additionally, when a creature starts its turn frightened 
                of him, it takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shackled Crown. While shackled, Aurelion Sol cannot be reduced below 1 hit point unless the crown is 
                disrupted. A creature adjacent to him can use an action to attempt to disrupt the crown with a DC 26 
                Arcana or Religion check. On a success, Aurelion Sol loses this trait until the end of his next turn.
            </p>
            <p>
                Starfire Existence. Aurelion Sol’s weapon attacks are magical. When he deals damage, he may choose 
                fire or radiant for that damage.
            </p>

            <hr>

            <h3>ACTIONS</h3>
            <p>
                Multiattack. Aurelion Sol makes three attacks: two with Claw and one with Tail, or two with Starfire 
                Breath (if available) and one with Tail.
            </p>
            <p>
                Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +17 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. <br>
                Hit: 22 (3d8 + 9) slashing damage plus 13 (3d8) fire or radiant damage.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tail. Melee Weapon Attack: +17 to hit, reach 25 ft., one target. <br>
                Hit: 25 (3d10 + 9) bludgeoning damage. If the target is Huge or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 25 
                Strength saving throw or be knocked prone and pushed 20 feet.
            </p>
            <p>
                Starfire Breath (Recharge 5–6). Aurelion Sol exhales a river of starfire in a 120-foot line that is 
                10 feet wide. <br>
                Each creature in the line must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw, taking 72 (16d8) fire or radiant 
                damage (Aurelion Sol’s choice) on a failed save, or half as much on a success. <br>
                A creature that fails is also blinded until the end of its next turn.
            </p>
            <p>
                Singularity (Recharge 6). Aurelion Sol creates a collapsing star at a point he can see within 150 feet. <br>
                Each creature in a 30-foot-radius sphere must make a DC 25 Strength saving throw. <br>
                On a failure, a creature takes 45 (10d8) force damage, is pulled up to 30 feet toward the center, and 
                is restrained until the end of its next turn. <br>
                On a success, it takes half damage and isn’t restrained.
            </p>
            <p>
                Astral Flight. Aurelion Sol moves up to his flying speed without provoking opportunity attacks. <br>
                He can move through creatures’ spaces during this movement; each creature he passes through takes 14 (4d6) 
                radiant damage, once per turn.
            </p>

            <hr>

            <h3>BONUS ACTIONS</h3>
            <p>
                Forge a Starlet. Aurelion Sol creates one orbiting “starlet” (max 3). Until destroyed (AC 19, 30 HP, immune 
                to poison/psychic), a starlet orbits him and sheds bright light 30 ft. and dim light 30 ft. Once per turn when 
                Aurelion Sol hits with an attack, he can have a starlet deal an extra 10 (3d6) radiant damage to the same target.
            </p>

            <hr>

            <h3>REACTIONS</h3>
            <p>
                Crown’s Reprimand. When a creature Aurelion Sol can see within 60 feet targets him with a spell, he can force that 
                creature to make a DC 25 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the spell is wasted and the caster takes 18 (4d8) psychic 
                damage.
            </p>

            <hr>

            <h3>LEGENDARY ACTIONS (3/round)</h3>
            <p>
                Aurelion Sol can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one option at a time and only at the 
                end of another creature’s turn.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Starlet Strike. One orbiting starlet makes a ranged spell attack: +16 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 14 
                    (4d6) radiant damage.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Gravity Twist. Each creature of Aurelion Sol’s choice within 20 feet must succeed on a DC 25 Strength save or be 
                    pulled 10 feet and have its speed halved until end of its next turn.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions). Aurelion Sol casts one spell from his Innate Spellcasting.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <hr>

            <h3>INNATE SPELLCASTING</h3>
            <p>
                Spell save DC 25, +16 to hit with spell attacks. He can innately cast: <br>
                At will: detect magic, dispel magic, wall of force <br>
                3/day each: sunbeam, reverse gravity, plane shift (self only) <br>
                1/day each: meteor swarm, time stop
            </p>
