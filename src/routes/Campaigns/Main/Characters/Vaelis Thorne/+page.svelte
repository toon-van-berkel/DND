            <h1>Backstory</h1>
            <p>
                Vaelis Thorne is twenty years old, lean and lightly built, moving with the 
                quiet economy of someone who has learned never to waste motion. He stands 
                just under average height, shoulders relaxed but alert, as if ready to vanish 
                at a moment’s notice. His true face — rarely seen — is pale and sharp-featured, 
                with silver-grey eyes that seem to catch more than light alone. His hair, 
                naturally white like bleached bone, is usually dyed dark or hidden beneath a 
                hood, and his skin carries the faint mottled tones common to changelings. He 
                dresses in muted colours: soft leather armour reinforced where it matters, boots 
                designed for silence, gloves thin enough to feel the breath of a lock beneath his 
                fingertips. Nothing he wears is ornamental. Every stitch serves survival.
            </p>
            <p>
                He was born in the Undercity, where stone presses down like a second sky and life 
                is measured in days survived rather than dreams imagined. Vaelis never knew his 
                parents — only the constant negotiation of hunger, fear, and opportunity. Being a 
                changeling meant learning early that his true form was dangerous. Difference drew 
                attention, and attention led to chains. So, he learned to borrow faces instead: a 
                gutter child’s innocence, a courier’s urgency, a servant’s bowed head. Faces became 
                tools, worn and discarded as easily as cloaks. Over time, his own face became 
                unfamiliar, something private and unused.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Undercity was brutal, but it was honest in its cruelty. Violence was open, hunger 
                was visible, and loyalty — when it existed — was earned. Above it all rose the upper 
                city, a world of light, clean stone, and elvish towers built on suffering they never 
                acknowledged. Elven overseers descended only when necessary, speaking in a flowing, 
                elegant language sharp with authority. Vaelis listened from vents, alleys, and stairwells, 
                memorizing cadence and meaning until Elvish (Sindarin) became another mask he could wear. 
                The language of the oppressors became a weapon of infiltration. Compared to the Undercity, 
                the upper city was beautiful — and utterly indifferent.
            </p>
            <p>
                As he grew older, Vaelis found steady work among thieves. Jobs came quietly: a mark 
                scratched into stone, a phrase in Thieves’ Cant whispered at the right corner, a name 
                passed without context. He specialized in problems others avoided — locks no one else 
                could open, guarded rooms that required more than silence, obstacles that needed 
                misdirection rather than force. It was during these jobs that something else awakened 
                in him. At first, it was small — a lock turning without being touched, a shadow seeming 
                deeper than it should be, a whispered illusion distracting a guard at the perfect moment. 
                Vaelis didn’t study magic; he stole it. Arcane knowledge lifted from discarded spellbooks, 
                overheard incantations, half-understood diagrams copied in charcoal. His magic was subtle, 
                instinctive, and precise — tricks meant to confuse, distract, and escape. A spectral hand 
                that slipped unseen through bars. A sound that wasn’t there. A face that wasn’t quite real. 
                He never called it spellcasting. To him, it was just another tool.
            </p>
            <p>
                His weapons reflected the same philosophy. Two daggers never left his side. Whisper, thin 
                and needle-pointed, was stolen during his first real job after unlocking a door no one 
                believed could be opened. Echo, curved and balanced, was earned later through a dangerous 
                exchange of information that saved another thief’s life. One distracted. One ended fight 
                quickly. Combined with his magic, Vaelis became something harder to catch — a thief who could 
                unlock doors from across the room and vanish behind illusions before blades were drawn. 
                He lived by a quiet certainty: if there’s a lock, there’s a way out.
            </p>
            <p>
                The job that shattered his life was supposed to be simple — a human merchant tied to slave 
                trafficking, careless and overconfident. Instead, it was a trap. Guards poured into the 
                hideout faster than anyone expected. In the chaos, Vaelis’ changeling nature was revealed, 
                his disguises stripped away by force. Shackles closed around his wrists. A cage slammed shut. 
                Reduced to property, he was loaded onto a transport bound for somewhere far worse. He escaped 
                only because his captors underestimated him — a hidden sliver of metal, a whispered cantrip, 
                a lock opened in darkness by an unseen hand. When the moment came, Vaelis ran. He fled until 
                the city vanished behind him and stone gave way to forest and open sky. Freedom terrified him 
                as much as chains once had, but he kept running anyway. And as he disappeared into the trees, 
                one truth burned brighter than fear:
            </p>
            <p>
                No lock will ever hold him again.
            </p>
