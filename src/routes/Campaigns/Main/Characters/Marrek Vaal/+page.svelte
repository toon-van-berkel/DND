            <h2>Origin</h2>
            <p>
                Marrek Vaal was born in the lowest levels of Rivulus, where names were traded for debts. 
                His family disappeared into slavery before he could remember their faces. He survived by 
                working the transport tunnels beneath the city, learning routes no guard bothered to map. 
                In time, he stopped fearing chains and began studying how they worked.

            <h2>Current Role</h2>
            <p>
                Marrek controls much of Rivulus’ slave movement and labor distribution. He owns the holding 
                pits where the newly captured are broken in spirit. He negotiates quietly with Sora’s 
                officials when shipments are required. No one enters or leaves Rivulus in chains without his 
                knowledge.

            <h2>Reputation</h2>
            <p>
                He is known for never raising his voice. He is known for iron discipline and flawless logistics. 
                He is known for punishing betrayal publicly and efficiently. He is known for saying, “Chains are 
                simply misplaced trust.”
