            <h2>Origin</h2>
            <p>
                Eldra Veil was born in Rivulus, and her infernal heritage became impossible to hide as she grew older.
                She learned early that people cling to any voice that promises relief.
                During a wave of sickness and desperation, she encountered the Echo Entity that would later be worshipped as a savior.
                She chose to shape that belief rather than destroy it, and the city began to listen.

            <h2>Current Role</h2>
            <p>
                Eldra preaches salvation in hidden chambers and broken chapels across Rivulus.
                She gathers the desperate and convinces them that devotion will lead to rescue.
                Each prayer strengthens the demigod she serves, even if no real salvation comes.
                She trades comfort and certainty for faith, and faith for power.
            </p>

            <h2>Reputation</h2>
            <p>
                She is known for sounding gentle even when speaking about ruin.
                She is known for “miracles” that feel real but never last.
                She is known for turning despair into devotion with a single conversation.
                She is known as the one who can make Rivulus believe again.
