            <h2>Origin</h2>
            <p>
                Iscara Morn grew up in Rivulus’ chemical back-alleys where smoke and sickness were normal.
                She learned alchemy by stealing half-burned notes and experimenting on what the city threw away.
                Her first “success” was a drug that made fear feel like faith for a few hours.
                After that, she stopped asking whether a cure or a weapon was the same thing.

            <h2>Current Role</h2>
            <p>
                Iscara creates rare substances that shift behavior, loyalty, and perception.
                She tests her work on Rivulus first, because no one up top cares what happens down here.
                She sells controlled doses to the powerful and poison to those she wants gone.
                Her long-term obsession is destabilizing Sora from within.
