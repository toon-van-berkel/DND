            <h2>Origin</h2>
            <p>
                Noct Sel came from the Underdark, where politics are sharper than blades.
                He learned to survive by collecting secrets before others could weaponize them.
                When his former masters fell, he vanished instead of dying for their mistakes.
                Rivulus welcomed him, because the city always needs someone who knows too much.

            <h2>Current Role</h2>
            <p>
                Noct runs Rivulus’ information network and blackmail trade.
                He buys confessions, steals letters, and archives sins like trophies.
                He manipulates conflict from the shadows, making rivals destroy themselves.
                He keeps lines into Sora as well, because true power crosses borders.
            </p>

            <h2>Reputation</h2>
            <p>
                He is known for choosing the most damaging truth, not the loudest one.
                He is known for offering “options” that are not really choices.
                He is known for smiling only when someone realizes they’re trapped.
                He is known as the man who can end you with a whisper.
