            <h2>Origin</h2>
            <p>
                Helior Quen was born among the duergar, raised where industry replaced mercy.
                He learned early that darkness makes people obedient and light makes them proud.
                When he came to Rivulus, he brought methods of rationing and control refined underground.
                He never needed a throne, because a single lamp can rule a room.

            <h2>Current Role</h2>
            <p>
                Helior controls candle wax, lamp oil, and the supply lines that keep Rivulus lit.
                He decides which districts earn light and which are left to rot in shadow.
                Wealthy patrons pay for brightness while the poor count minutes of flame.
                Every night in Rivulus is, in part, his decision.
