            <h2>Origin</h2>
            <p>
                Ryn Locke rose from Rivulus’ hard streets where surviving meant learning every exit.
                He trained as a soldier, but his true talent was understanding doors, routes, and systems.
                He studied old tunnel maps and forbidden corridors until the city felt like an opened lock in his hands.
                Over time, he became the one Rivulus trusted to keep order without mercy.

            <h2>Current Role</h2>
            <p>
                Ryn serves as Rivulus’ warrior-commander and the master of access.
                He controls gates, vaults, checkpoints, and the hidden paths between districts.
                He decides who moves freely and who gets stopped before they can become a problem.
                If Rivulus is a prison, Ryn is the keyring.
