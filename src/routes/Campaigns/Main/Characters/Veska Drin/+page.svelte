            <h2>Origin</h2>
            <p>
                Veska Drin died once in Rivulus and came back wrong, like a memory stitched into flesh.
                She wandered the tunnels until she found hidden clean water sources no one else could trace.
                Disease followed her footsteps, but so did cures, and people stopped asking questions.
                Rivulus gave her space, because survival always comes before comfort.
            </p>

            <h2>Current Role</h2>
            <p>
                Veska controls access to clean water and hides it to keep the city dependent.
                She understands how sickness spreads and how to stop it, and she uses both skills.
                She sells cures, but never cures the system that creates the illness.
                If Rivulus drinks today, it is because Veska allowed it.
