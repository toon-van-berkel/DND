            <h2>Origin</h2>
            <p>
                Maera Kull’s life ended in a plague season that left Rivulus drowning in bodies.
                She returned as a vampire, not by choice but by consequence of someone else’s hunger.
                The Undercity did not exile her—it simply made room, because need is stronger than fear.
                She learned that healing is the most profitable form of control.
            </p>

            <h2>Current Role</h2>
            <p>
                Maera offers cures, treatments, and temporary relief for those who can pay.
                She delays healing on purpose, stretching suffering into dependence.
                Her clinics are half sanctuary, half trap, and everyone knows it.
                When people run out of coin, she offers other ways to settle the debt.
            </p>

            <h2>Reputation</h2>
            <p>
                She is known for saving lives while ruining futures.
                She is known for smiling kindly as she measures the price of survival.
                She is known for keeping patients alive just long enough to keep paying.
                She is known as the Nightbringer—because night is when deals are made.
